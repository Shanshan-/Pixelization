- implementing palette refinement
- expanding palette
- when performing principal component anylysis, perform on each channel seperately, to get the individual values 
	needed for calculations

TODOs
- add an image abstract class (rename currt Image class too)
- perturbing of color in palette is along principal component axis in LAB space
- maybe move mean color calcuation into the Palette class
- LAB space is shifted: (usage in code is proportional, so shouldn't need to be adressed)
	l = l * 255/100
	a = a + 128
	b = b + 128

- odd pixel display bug at low sp scale

MCDA notes
- palette size should always be some multiple of two
- use PCA to divide starting color into two slight permutations
- add both colors to the palette, keeping track of what two colors are a pair
- start loop:
	- perform association, refinement, etc. as if the two were seperate colors
	- upon convergence, check the euclidean distance between each pair
	- if the distance is greater than some threshold, then register each as a seperate color
		- if multiple, start with greatest distance first
	- take average of all remaining pairs as to be the new palette
	- perform PCA on each color to determine representatives, and continue with association
		- merge pair superpixels if cluster merges
- small details
	- maximum size of palette should be 2*user input, since two centers per palette color
	- add method:
		- returns representative color (avg of clusters)
		- returns distance between palette clusters
		- splits a color into two
	- do not need to perform early PCA, since each pair already has its associated super pixels
