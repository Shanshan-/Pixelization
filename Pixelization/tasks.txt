- implementing palette refinement
- expanding palette
- when performing principal component anylysis, perform on each channel seperately, to get the individual values 
	needed for calculations

TODOs
- add an image abstract class (rename currt Image class too)
- perturbing of color in palette is along principal component axis in LAB space
- maybe move mean color calcuation into the Palette class
